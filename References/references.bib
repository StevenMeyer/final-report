	annote={This book covers the use of UML for Software Engineering. This book was examined for its relevance to using a UML subset for describing a database schema. It did not prove to be of any particular use, however, as the Umanath \& Scamell book covered these topics in greater detail.}

	annote={This section of the Propel ORM documentation is concerned with relationships between entities. It describes different relationship type such as 1:1 and m:n and how these are set out in the XML schema. This section, however, relates to functionality which has not, yet, been implemented in the project.}

	annote={This section of the Propel ORM documentation is an almost complete reference for the XML schema. It describes the hierarchy of the XML nodes and gives explanations of most of the attributes and their default values. This reference documentation has been frequently consulted and will continue to be the major source of Propel schema information for future iterations. There are some things missing, however, which will hopefully be available in other documentation or else will require running the Propel software and experimentation.}

	annote={This web-page includes an introduction to using XSLTunit, the unit testing framework for XSL transformations. It describes how to create an XSL stylesheet describing the tests and how to apply it to test data and the XSLT files to test in order to generate the results. This page was used when WWW SQL Designer was being used and XSL transforms were transforming the XML into Propel-formatted XML.}

It was used in conjunction with Sebesta's book to generate a detailed description of the functions described in the book. That is to say that the book described using different elements to achieve different goals, and this resource was used to describe the elements in more detail in order to decide how to apply them to the problems in the project.}

	annote={This book describes the two different styles for developing software, the centrally designed and architected ``cathedral'' method used in commercial software and the opposite ``bazaar'' model which Raymond likens to Linux development. This book was examined for its relevance to one of the project goals of potentially becoming an open-source software project. However, as the project is still in its infancy, the project has not been opened up in this way, so the revelations of this book are not yet relevant.}

Databases can be usefully modelled as Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs). Such diagrams use visuals to show information about database schemata such as relationships and cardinalities, entities and attributes in a way which is easy for a human to recognise. Colouring and emphasis can further assist in using ERDs as a useful tool for sharing and communicating a database schema.
\\

Propel is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for PHP. It creates objects to allow for programmatic database manipulation and for database abstraction. It creates these objects and the database implementation from schema files. These schemata define the tables, columns, keys, indices and relations and their attributes within a database.
\\

Schema files are coded in XML. While this makes them understandable so far as the data is marked-up in a human-readable manner, it makes sharing and collaborating difficult. The linear structure of the XML makes it difficult to see the structure of the database and relationships. This, in turn, makes it difficult to ensure that the schema is modelling the domain and following business logic correctly. They are also not very friendly for the less technically-inclined.

It can be seen, then, that it would be useful to have a tool which can be used to manipulate Propel schemata by means of direct XML manipulation and by ERDs.

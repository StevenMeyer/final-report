	\item My supervisor, Professor Reyer Zwiggelaar, for allowing me to create this project at my own pace and for encouraging me to do my best.
	\item My long-suffering partner, Aylin Alieva, for putting up with me throughout all of my years at the University, but particularly for these final months of dissertation work. 
	\item The Father and the Son, for giving me strength.
\end{itemize}
